# Mosaic-Pictures

This is my ENG 1002 Programming (Matlab & C) personal project. (2021 Year 1 Semester 1)

This program can be used to mosaic the picture in a custom way by selecting some rectangle areas on the picture.

This program is written in Matlab language, and some pictures have been provided for the testing purpose.

Please download 'final_version.m' and 'readimage.m' files.
